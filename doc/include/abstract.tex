We present a framework for performance analysis of multiprocessor systems whose
timing characteristics are uncertain at the design stage. Apart from static,
aggregative quantities of interest, the framework is readily applicable to the
analysis of dynamic, transitional quantities such as power and temperature
profiles. The proposed technique is based on adaptive hierarchical
interpolation and is capable of tackling problems with non-smooth response
surfaces.
