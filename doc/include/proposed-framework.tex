The proposed framework is composed of a number of stages outlined below and discussed in details in the corresponding subsections.

\stage{Stage 1.}{Uncertain Parameters Processing (\sref{uncertain-parameters}).} The dependent uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ are expressed in terms of mutually independent \rvs\ $\vZ(\o)$.

\stage{Stage 2.}{Time Modeling (\sref{timing-model}).} Spectral expansions of the execution, start, and end times of the tasks $\tasks$ of the application $\application$ are computed. The expansions can be readily employed to perform timing analysis of the system.

\stage{Stage 3.}{Power Modeling (\sref{power-model}).} Spectral expansions of the dynamic power dissipation of the platform at time points of interest are constructed based on the time expansions from Stage~2. The expansions can be readily utilized to derive the needed characteristics of the system.

\stage{Stage 4.}{Temperature Modeling (\sref{thermal-model}).} Spectral expansions of the temperature evolution are obtained based on the power expansions calculated at Stage~3. The expansions can be readily used to compute the desired parameters of the system.
