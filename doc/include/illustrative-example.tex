\subsection{Uncertain Parameters}
Since rank-based measures of correlations (a) are more powerful and robust than their liner counterparts, (b) can be captured with no additional costs, and (c) do not introduce any post-processing complexity, we focus on rank correlations, which has no loss of generality.
