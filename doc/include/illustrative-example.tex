\subsection{Uncertain Parameters}
Since rank-based measures of correlations (a) are more powerful and robust than their liner counterparts, (b) can be captured with no extra costs, and (c) do not introduce any additional post-processing complexity, we focus on rank correlations, which has no loss of generality. Also, we choose to work with uniform \rvs; hence, the inner most transformation in \eref{parametrization} is omitted.
