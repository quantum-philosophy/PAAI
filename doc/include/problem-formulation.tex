Consider a multiprocessor system composed of two major components: a platform
and an application. The platform consists of a set of heterogeneous processing
elements $\procs = \{ 1, 2, \dots, \np \}$ and is equipped with a thermal
package. The application is given as a set of tasks $\tasks = \{ 1, 2, \dots,
\nt \}$. In what follows, the system will be denoted by $(\procs, \tasks)$.

The mapping of the application onto the platform is assumed to be fixed and
given by a vector $\mapping = (m_i)_{i = 1}^{\nt}$ such that $m_i$ is the index
of the processing element that the $i$th task is assigned to. The power
consumption of the tasks is assumed to be fixed and given by a vector $\power =
(p_i)_{i = 1}^{\nt}$ such that $p_i$ is the power of the $i$th task. Note that
the boundaries of a task have not been specified, and one can perform modeling
at the level of granularity that makes the most sense for a particular problem.

The system depends on a set of parameters that are uncertain at the design
stage. We model such uncertain parameters as a random vector $\vu = (\u_i)_{i =
1}^\nu$. The focus of this work is on those parameters that affect the timing
characteristics of the system, which will be described shortly. This variability
inevitably implies that the corresponding power and temperature profiles of the
system are uncertain for the designer as well.

Each task is ascribed two variables that determine the beginning of the task's
execution time interval and its duration. For the $i$th task, denote these two
variables by $\b_i$ and $\d_i$, respectively, and let $\vb = (\b_i)_{i=1}^{\nt}$
and $\vd = (\d_i)_{i=1}^{\nt}$. Let $\schedule$ be a (deterministic) scheduling
policy that determines the tuple $(\vb, \vd)$ given $\vu$, which we shall denote
by $\schedule(\vu) = (\vb, \vd)$.

We pursue the following major objectives:
\begin{itemize}

  \item {\bfseries Objective~1.} Develop a framework for transient temperature
    analysis of the system $(\procs, \tasks)$ with the given mapping $\mapping$,
    power consumption $\power$, and scheduling policy $\schedule$ such that the
    uncertainty due the parameters $\vu$---affecting the timing characteristics
    of the system comprised in the tuple $(\vb, \vd)$---is taken into
    consideration.

\end{itemize}
