In this section, we present an approach to uncertainty quantification that forms
the core of the proposed framework. The approach belongs to the class of
stochastic collocation techniques \cite{xiu2010}. The major distinctive feature
of stochastic collocation is the usage of interpolation as a means of
uncertainty quantification, which should be contrasted with other techniques
such as polynomial chaos expansions relying on regression. The algorithm that we
use is based on adaptive sparse-grid interpolation, and it was developed in
\cite{klimke2006} and \cite{ma2009}.

Let $f$ be an uncertain quantity that we are interested in studying. The
quantity is viewed as a vector of $\nout$ deterministic functions each of which
is parametrized by the same set of $\nin$ random variables. Each function
belongs to $\continuous([0, 1]^\nin)$, the space of continuous functions defined
on the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^\nin$. Thus, we have
\[
  f: [0, 1]^\nin \to \real^\nout \subset \continuous([0, 1]^\nin).
\]
Note that the domain $[0, 1]^\nin$ is not a restriction.

The function is assumed to be computationally intensive and impractical for
extensive evaluation, which is needed for Monte Carlo sampling. For example, the
concise notation $f$ might expand into a full-system simulation, including
scheduling and power-temperature analysis, which is the case in this work.

In order to make the problem computationally tractable, a light representation
of $f$ is constructed and studied instead of $f$. The surrogate is based on
interpolation: $f$ is evaluated at a small number of points or nodes, and any
other values of $f$ are reconstructed on demand using a set of basis functions
mediating between the obtained values of $f$.

In what follows, we shall gradually construct an efficient interpolant for $f$.
\emph{Efficiency}, in this context, refers to the number of nodes required to
achieve a certain accuracy level.
