Our work brings the following major contributions:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bfseries Contribution~1.} We develop a flexible framework for
  performance analysis of multiprocessor systems that takes into account the
  designer's lack of knowledge about the actual (runtime) timing characteristics
  of such systems.

\end{itemize}
