In \sref{modeling}, we formalized the uncertainty originating from variable
timing characteristics of multiprocessor systems and introduced a number of
models of the quantities that the designer is typically interested in knowing.
In the previous section, \sref{interpolation}, we were concerned with
constructing an efficient approximant of a hypothetical multi-input multi-output
function $\f$. In what follows, we shall amalgamate the ideas developed in the
aforementioned two sections.

Our solution has already been delineated in \sref{solution}.
