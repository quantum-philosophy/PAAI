In \sref{modeling}, we formalized the uncertainty originating from variable
timing characteristics of multiprocessor systems and introduced a number of
models of the quantities that the designer is typically interested in knowing.
In the previous section, \sref{interpolation}, we were concerned with
constructing an efficient approximant of a hypothetical multi-input multi-output
function $\f$. In what follows, we shall amalgamate the ideas developed in the
aforementioned two sections.

Recall that the quantity of interest $\g$ is expensive to evaluate and, hence,
is not suitable for Monte Carlo (\abbr{MC}) sampling. Recall also that $\g$ is
parametrized by the random variables $\vz$ via the transformation
$\transformation$, as discussed in \sref{problem-formulation} and
\sref{uncertain-parameters}. The only source of randomness is $\vz$; the rest is
purely deterministic.
