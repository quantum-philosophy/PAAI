Let $\probabilitySpace$ be a probability space where $\outcomes$ is a set of
outcomes, $\sigmaAlgebra \subseteq 2^\outcomes$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, and
$\probabilityMeasure: \sigmaAlgebra \to [0, 1]$ is a probability measure
\cite{durrett2010}. A \rv\ on $\probabilitySpace$ is an
$\sigmaAlgebra$-measurable function $\h: \outcomes \to \real$. Such a variable
is uniquely characterized by its distribution function defined by
\begin{equation*}
  \distribution_\h(z) := \probabilityMeasure(\h \leq z) = \probabilityMeasure(\{ \o \in \outcomes: \h(\o) \leq z \}),
\end{equation*}
which is denoted by $\h \sim \distribution_\h$. The expectation and variance of
$\h$ are given by
\begin{align}
  & \expectation{\h} := \int_\outcomes \h(\o) \, d\probabilityMeasure(\o) = \int_\real z \, d \distribution_\h(z) \hspace{1em} \text{and} \elab{expectation} \\
  & \variance{\h} := \expectation{(\h - \expectation{\h})^2}, \nonumber
\end{align}
respectively. A random vector $\vh = (\h_i)_{i = 1}^n: \outcomes \to \real^n$ is
a vector whose elements are \rvs.
