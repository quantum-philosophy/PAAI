We present a framework for probabilistic analysis of multiprocessor systems that
have uncertain parameters at the design stage. The proposed approach thrives on
adaptive hierarchical interpolation followed by computer experiments, which
makes it general and suitable for studying various quantities that are of
interest to the designer. The framework is capable of addressing static,
aggregative quantities as well as dynamic, transient ones. The examples of the
former include the end-to-end delay, total energy consumption, and maximal
temperature of the system at hand, and the examples of the latter include the
system's power consumption and heat dissipation as functions of time. The
framework allows for a straightforward, computationally efficient estimation of
probability distributions and provides analytical formulae for expected values
and variances. Our technique is illustrated by considering a number of problems
and comparing the corresponding results, in terms of both speed and accuracy,
with exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations.
