We present a system-level framework for the analysis of electronic systems whose
runtime behavior dependents on uncertain parameters. The proposed approach
thrives on adaptive hierarchical interpolation, which makes it general and
suitable for studying various quantities that are of interest to the designer.
Examples include the end-to-end delay, total energy consumption, and maximal
temperature of the system at hand. The framework delivers a light generative
model and allows for a straightforward, computationally efficient calculation of
the probability distribution and accompanying statistics of the quantity of
interest. Our technique is illustrated by considering a number of applications
and comparing the corresponding results, in terms of both speed and accuracy,
with exhaustive simulations.
