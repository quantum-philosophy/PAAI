We present a design-time system-level framework for analyzing electronic systems
whose runtime behaviors dependent on parameters that are uncertain at the design
stage. The proposed approach thrives on hierarchical interpolation guided by an
advanced adaptation strategy, which makes the framework general and suitable for
studying various quantities that are of interest to the designer. Examples of
such quantities include the end-to-end delay, total energy consumption, and
maximum temperature of the system under consideration. The framework delivers a
light generative representation that allows for a straightforward,
computationally efficient calculation of the probability distribution and
concomitant statistics of the quantity of interest. Our technique is illustrated
by considering a number of uncertainty-quantification problems and comparing the
corresponding results with exhaustive simulations.
