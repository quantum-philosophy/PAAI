We present a framework for probabilistic analysis of multiprocessor systems that
have uncertain parameters at the design stage. The proposed approach is very
general and suitable for studying various quantities that are of interest for
the designer. The framework is capable of addressing static, aggregative
quantities as well as dynamic, transient ones. The examples of the former
include the end-to-end delay, average power, total energy, and maximal
temperature, and the examples of the latter include the power and temperature
profiles of the system at hand. Our probabilistic analysis thrives on adaptive
hierarchical sparse-grid interpolation followed by computer experiments.
