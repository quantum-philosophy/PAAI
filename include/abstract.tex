We present a design-time system-level framework for the analysis of electronic
systems whose runtime behavior dependents on uncertain parameters. The proposed
approach thrives on hierarchical interpolation with hybrid adaptivity, which
makes it general and suitable for studying various quantities that are of
interest to the designer. Examples of such quantities include the end-to-end
delay, total energy consumption, and maximum temperature of the system under
consideration. The framework delivers a light generative model that allows for a
straightforward, computationally efficient calculation of the probability
distribution and concomitant statistics of the quantity of interest. Our
technique is illustrated by considering a number of uncertainty-quantification
problems and comparing the corresponding results with extensive simulations.
