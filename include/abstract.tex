We present a framework for system-level analysis of electronic systems whose
runtime behaviors depend on uncertain parameters. \updated{The proposed approach
thrives on hierarchical interpolation guided by an advanced adaptation strategy,
which makes the framework general and suitable for studying various metrics that
are of interest to the designer. Examples of such metrics include the end-to-end
delay, total energy consumption, and maximum temperature of the system under
consideration. The framework delivers a light generative representation that
allows for a straightforward, computationally efficient calculation of the
probability distribution and accompanying statistics of the metric.} Our
technique is illustrated by considering a number of uncertainty-quantification
problems and comparing the corresponding results with exhaustive simulations.
