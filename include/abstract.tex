We present a system-level design-time framework for the analysis of
multiprocessor systems dependent on uncertain parameters. The proposed approach
thrives on adaptive hierarchical interpolation, which makes it general and
suitable for studying various quantities that are of interest to the designer.
The framework is capable of addressing static, aggregative quantities as well as
dynamic, transient ones. The examples of the former include the end-to-end
delay, total energy consumption, and maximal temperature of the system under
consideration, and the examples of the latter include the system's power
consumption and heat dissipation as functions of time. The framework delivers a
light generative model and allows for a straightforward, computationally
efficient estimation of the probability distributions and accompanying
statistics of the quantities of interest. Our technique is illustrated by
considering a number of applications and comparing the corresponding results, in
terms of both speed and accuracy, with exhaustive simulations.
