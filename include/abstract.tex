We present a framework for system-level analysis of electronic systems whose
runtime behaviors depend on uncertain parameters. The proposed approach thrives
on hierarchical interpolation guided by an advanced adaptation strategy, which
makes the framework general and suitable for studying various quantities that
are of interest to the designer. Examples of such quantities include the
end-to-end delay, total energy consumption, and maximum temperature of the
system under consideration. The framework delivers a light generative
representation that allows for a straightforward, computationally efficient
calculation of the probability distribution and concomitant statistics of the
quantity of interest. Our technique is illustrated by considering a number of
uncertainty-quantification problems and comparing the corresponding results with
exhaustive simulations.
