We present a design-time system-level framework for the analysis of electronic
systems whose runtime behavior dependents on uncertain parameters. The proposed
approach thrives on adaptive hierarchical interpolation, which makes it general
and suitable for studying various quantities that are of interest to the
designer. Examples of such quantities include the end-to-end delay, total energy
consumption, and maximal temperature of the system under consideration. The
framework delivers a light generative model and allows for a straightforward,
computationally efficient calculation of the probability distribution and
accompanying statistics of the quantity of interest. Our technique is
illustrated by considering a number of applications and comparing the
corresponding results, in terms of both speed and accuracy, with exhaustive
simulations.
