Our work brings the following major contribution: we develop an efficient
framework for probabilistic analysis of electronic systems that is
straightforward to use and is applicable to a wide range of
uncertainty-quantification problems.

The usage of our framework is streamlined because it has the same low entrance
requirements as sampling techniques: one only has to be able to evaluate the
quantity of interest given a set of deterministic parameters. Moreover, the
framework can be utilized in scenarios with limited knowledge about the joint
probability distribution of the uncertain parameters, which are common in
practice (to be elaborated on in \sref{parameters}).

The scope of our framework is wide because the framework has a powerful
approximation engine. We make use of hierarchical interpolation with hybrid
adaptivity \cite{jakeman2012, klimke2006, ma2009}, which enables us to tackle
diverse electronic-system-design problems while keeping the associated
computation costs low. In particular, the framework is suitable for nonsmooth
problems, which is an important feature in the context of electronic systems due
to their digital nature, as discussed in \sref{introduction}.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to use the
above-mentioned adaptive interpolation technique in the context of probabilistic
analysis of electronic systems.

In addition to the aforementioned contribution, we open-source our
implementation \cite{sources}. The code base also includes the whole
experimental setup described in \sref{experimentation}.
