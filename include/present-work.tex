Our work brings the following major contribution: We develop a framework for
probabilistic analysis of electronic systems that is straightforward to use and
is applicable to a wide range of uncertainty-quantification problems.

The usage of the framework is streamlined because it has the same low entrance
requirements as sampling techniques: one only has to be able to evaluate the
quantity of interest given a set of deterministic parameters. Moreover, the
framework can be utilized in scenarios with limited knowledge about the joint
probability distribution of the uncertain parameters, which are common in
practice (to be elaborated on in \sref{parameters}).

The scope of the framework is wide because the framework has a powerful
approximation engine. We make use of adaptive hierarchical interpolation on
sparse grids \cite{jakeman2012, klimke2006, ma2009}, which enable us to tackle
diverse electronic-system-design problems while keeping the associated
computation costs low. In particular, the framework is suitable for nonsmooth
problems, which is an important feature in the context of electronic systems due
to their digital nature, as discussed in \sref{introduction}.

In addition to the aforementioned contribution, we open-source our
implementation \cite{sources}. The implementation is broken down into multiple
standalone libraries, which makes it well disposed to cherry-picked reusage. The
code base also includes the whole experimental setup described in
\sref{experimentation}.
