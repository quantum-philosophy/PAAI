Our work brings the following major contribution: we develop an efficient
framework for probabilistic analysis of electronic systems that is
straightforward to use and is applicable to a wide range of
uncertainty-quantification problems.

The usage of our framework is streamlined because it has the same low entrance
requirements as sampling techniques: one only has to be able to evaluate the
quantity of interest given a set of deterministic parameters. Moreover, the
framework can be utilized in scenarios with limited knowledge about the joint
probability distribution of the uncertain parameters, which are common in
practice (to be elaborated on in \sref{parameters}).

The scope of our framework is wide because the framework features a powerful
approximation engine. We make use of hierarchical interpolation with hybrid
adaptivity on sparse grids \cite{jakeman2012, klimke2006, ma2009}, which enables
us to tackle diverse design problems while keeping the associated computation
costs low.

To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one to address
systematically and efficiently nonsmooth problems in the context of
probabilistic analysis of electronic systems. The importance of the
characteristic is motivated in \sref{introduction}.

In addition to the aforementioned contribution, we open-source our
implementation \cite{sources}. The code base also includes the whole
experimental setup described in \sref{experimentation}.
