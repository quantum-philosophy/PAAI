Our work brings the following major contributions:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Contribution~1.} We develop a flexible framework for probabilistic
  analysis of multiprocessor systems that takes into account the designer's lack
  of knowledge about the timing characteristics of such systems.

\end{itemize}
