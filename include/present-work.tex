Our work brings the following major contribution. We develop a framework for
probabilistic analysis of electronic systems that is easy to use and is
applicable to diverse uncertainty-quantification problems. The framework can be
utilized in scenarios with a limited knowledge about the joint probability
distribution of the uncertain parameters, which are common in practice. The
approach that we take belongs to the class of stochastic collocation techniques
\cite{xiu2010}. The major distinctive feature of stochastic collocation is the
usage of interpolation as a means of uncertainty quantification, which should be
contrasted with other techniques such as polynomial chaos expansions relying on
regression. More concretely, our framework make use of adaptive hierarchical
interpolation on sparse grids \cite{klimke2006, ma2009}, which enables the
framework to preserve the virtue of Monte Carlo methods while substantially
reducing the costs associated with the sampling process.

In this paper, we are mainly oriented towards digital sources of uncertainty
introduced earlier, and our examples and experimental setup has been tailored
accordingly. However, the framework is expected to perform well when modeling
other uncertainties such as those due to process variation.
