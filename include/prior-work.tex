In order to eliminate or reduce the costs associated with compute experiments, a
number of techniques have been introduced.

Probabilistic timing analysis.

Regarding probabilistic power analysis, the analysis under process variation is
considered in \cite{ukhov2014}.

Let us turn to probabilistic temperature analysis. The analysis under process
variation is considered in \cite{ukhov2014} and \cite{ukhov2015}.
