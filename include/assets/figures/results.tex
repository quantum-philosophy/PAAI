    Experimental results. There are considered 3 quantities, 3 platform sizes,
    and 2 application sizes. The columns correspond to the three quantities: the
    end-to-end delay (left), total energy (middle), and maximum temperature
    (right). The three pairs of rows correspond to the three platform sizes: 2
    (top), 4 (middle), and 8 (bottom) processing elements. The rows alternate
    between the two application sizes: 10 (odd) and 20 (even) tasks. The
    horizontal axes show the number of points, and the vertical ones the error
    on a logarithmic scale. The solid lines correspond to our technique, and the
    dashed ones to direct sampling.
