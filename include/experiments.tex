In this section, we evaluate the performance of our framework. Our
implementation is open source and can be found at \cite{sources}, which also
includes the experimental setup along with configuration files and input data.
The experiments discussed below are conducted on a \up{GNU}/Linux machine
equipped with 16 processors Intel Xeon E5520 2.27~\up{GH}z and 24~\up{GB} of
\up{RAM}.

We shall address $3 \times 2 \times 3 = 18$ uncertainty-quantification problems.
Specifically, we shall consider three platform sizes $\np$: 2, 4, and 8
processing elements; two application sizes $\nt$: 10 and 20 tasks; and three
metrics $\g$: the end-to-end delay, total energy consumption, and maximum
temperature defined in \eref{end-to-end-delay}, \eref{total-energy}, and
\eref{maximum-temperature}, respectively. At this point, it might be helpful to
recall the example in \fref{example}.
