The agenda for this section is as follows. In \sref{parameters}, the uncertain
parameters $\vu$ are transformed into a form suitable for the subsequent
calculations. This stage is an essential part of our framework. The rest of the
subsections, \sref{time}, \sref{power}, and \sref{temperature}, serve a strictly
illustrative purpose. \updated{They introduce a number of models and a number of
metrics $\g$ in order to give the reader a better intuition about the utility of
the framework. These models and metrics also give us concrete problems to work
with in the section on experimental results, \sref{experimentation}.} It should
be well understood that the essence of $\g$ is problem specific. Therefore, the
exact formulation of $\g$ is left to the designer's discretion.

\subsection{Uncertainty Parameters} \slab{parameters}
\input{include/modeling/parameters}

\subsection{Application Timing} \slab{time}
\input{include/modeling/time}

\subsection{Power Consumption} \slab{power}
\input{include/modeling/power}

\subsection{Heat Dissipation} \slab{temperature}
\input{include/modeling/temperature}

To sum up, we have discussed the transformation that needs to be applied to
$\vu$ prior to the interpolation of $\g$. \updated{We have also covered three
facets of electronic systems, namely, timing, power, and temperature, and
introduced a number of metrics associated with them; we shall come back to these
metrics in the section on experimental results, \sref{experimentation}.}
