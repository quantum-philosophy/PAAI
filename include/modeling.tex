The agenda for this section is as follows. In \sref{uncertain-parameters}, the
uncertain parameters $\vu$ are transformed in a form suitable for the future
calculations. In the rest of the subsections, \sref{application-timing},
\sref{power-consumption}, and \sref{heat-dissipation}, a number of system models
are introduced, which give birth to various quantities that are of interest to
the designer of multiprocessor systems. Some of the quantities mentioned in this
section will be further considered in the experimental results given in
\sref{experimental-results}.
