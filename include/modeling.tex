The agenda for this section is as follows. In \sref{parameters}, the uncertain
parameters $\vu$ are transformed in a form suitable for the subsequent
calculations. In the rest of the subsections, \sref{time}, \sref{power}, and
\sref{temperature}, a number of system models are introduced, which give birth
to various quantities that are of interest to the designer of electronic
systems.

\subsection{Uncertainty Parameters} \slab{parameters}
\input{include/modeling/parameters}

\subsection{Application Timing} \slab{time}
\input{include/modeling/time}

\subsection{Power Consumption} \slab{power}
\input{include/modeling/power}

\subsection{Heat Dissipation} \slab{temperature}
\input{include/modeling/temperature}

To conclude, we have covered three facets of an electronic system, namely,
timing, power, and heat, and introduced a number of quantities associated with
them, which we will come back to in the section on experimental results,
\sref{experimentation}. We have also discussed the transformation that needs to
be applied to $\vu$ prior to the interpolation of $\g$, and now we are ready to
move on to the interpolation itself.
