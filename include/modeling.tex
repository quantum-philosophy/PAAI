The agenda for this section is as follows. In \sref{uncertain-parameters}, the
uncertain parameters $\vu$ are transformed in a form suitable for the subsequent
calculations. In the rest of the subsections, \sref{application-timing},
\sref{power-consumption}, and \sref{heat-dissipation}, a number of system models
are introduced, which give birth to various quantities that are of interest to
the designer of electronic systems.

\input{include/modeling/uncertain-parameters}

\subsection{Application Timing} \slab{application-timing}
\input{include/modeling/application-timing}

\subsection{Power Consumption} \slab{power-consumption}
\input{include/modeling/power-consumption}

\subsection{Heat Dissipation} \slab{heat-dissipation}
\input{include/modeling/heat-dissipation}

To conclude, we have covered three facets of an electronic system, namely,
timing, power, and heat, and introduced a number of quantities associated with
them, which we will come back to in the section on experimental results,
\sref{experimentation}. We have also discussed the transformation that needs to
be applied to $\vu$ prior to the interpolation of $\g$, and now we are ready to
move on to the interpolation itself.
