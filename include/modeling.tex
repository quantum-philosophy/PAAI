The agenda for this section is as follows. In \sref{parameters}, the uncertain
parameters $\vu$ are transformed into a form suitable for the subsequent
calculations. \updated{This stage is an essential part of our framework, and it
is denoted by $\transformation$ in \fref{example}.} The rest of the subsections,
\sref{time}--\ref{sec:temperature}, serve a strictly illustrative purpose.
\updated{They exemplify the leftmost box in \fref{example} in order to give the
reader a better intuition about the utility of the framework. The subsections
introduce a number of models and a number of metrics $\g$; however, it should be
well understood that the essence of $\g$ is problem specific. In practice, $\g$
stands for an adequate simulator of the system under consideration. The modeling
capabilities of this simulator are naturally inherited by the proposed
framework.}

\subsection{Uncertainty Parameters} \slab{parameters}
\input{include/modeling/parameters}

\subsection{Application Timing} \slab{time}
\input{include/modeling/time}

\subsection{Power Consumption} \slab{power}
\input{include/modeling/power}

\subsection{Heat Dissipation} \slab{temperature}
\input{include/modeling/temperature}

To sum up, we have discussed the transformation that needs to be applied to
$\vu$ prior to the interpolation of $\g$. \updated{We have also covered three
aspects of electronic systems, namely, timing, power, and temperature, and
introduced a number of metrics associated with them; we shall come back to these
metrics in the section on experimental results, \sref{experimentation}.}
