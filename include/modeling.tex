The agenda for this section is as follows. In \sref{parameters}, the uncertain
parameters $\vu$ are transformed into a form suitable for the subsequent
calculations. This stage is an essential part of our framework. The rest of the
subsections, \sref{time}, \sref{power}, and \sref{temperature}, serve a strictly
educational, illustrative purpose. They introduce a number of models and a
number of quantities of interest $\g$ in order to give the reader a better
intuition about the utility of the framework. These models and quantities also
give us concrete problems to work with in the section on experimental results,
\sref{experimentation}. It should be well understood that the essence of $\g$ is
problem specific. Therefore, the exact formulation of $\g$ is left to the
designer's discretion.

\subsection{Application Timing} \slab{time}

\subsection{Power Consumption} \slab{power}
\input{include/modeling/power}

\subsection{Heat Dissipation} \slab{temperature}
\input{include/modeling/temperature}

To conclude, we have covered three facets of an electronic system, namely,
timing, power, and temperature, and introduced a number of quantities associated
with them; we will come back to them in the section on experimental results,
\sref{experimentation}. We have also discussed the transformation that needs to
be applied to $\vu$ prior to the interpolation of $\g$, and we are now ready to
move on to the interpolation procedure itself.
