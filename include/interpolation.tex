In this section, we present the algorithm that constitutes the core of the
proposed framework for probabilistic analysis of electronic systems.
\updated{This part corresponds to the third box from the left in
\fref{example}.} The algorithm is based on the work in \cite{jakeman2012,
klimke2006, ma2009}, and it features a sparse-grid structure, hierarchical
construction, and hybrid adaptivity. The benefits of these features are
interconnected and can be summarized as follows: the ability to efficiently
tackle multidimensional problems, the ability to perform gradual refinement of
the approximation with a natural error control, and the ability to make the
refinement fine-grained and, therefore, gain further efficiency.

Let $\f$ be a function that we would like to approximate; the connection between
$\f$ and $\g$ will be explained in \sref{analysis}. The function is assumed to
be in $\continuous([0, 1]^\nin)$, the space of continuous functions in the unit
hypercube $[0, 1]^\nin$. The assumption is a formality and does not impose any
restrictions in practice. In what follows, we shall gradually construct an
efficient interpolant for $\f$. Efficiency refers to the number of function
evaluations required to achieve a certain accuracy level.

To summarize, we have obtained an efficient algorithm for adaptive hierarchical
interpolation in multiple dimensions. The main equation is \eref{approximation}
where $\surplus$, $\vx_{\vi\vj}$, and $\e_{\vi\vj}$ are the ones given in
\sref{smolyak}, \sref{grid}, and \sref{basis}, respectively, and the
interpolation procedure is undertaken according to the rules given in
\sref{adaptivity}. In the next subsection, we shall discuss the algorithmic
structure of our interpolation.

\subsection{Implementation} \slab{implementation}
\input{include/interpolation/implementation}

To recapitulate, in this section, we have presented the key component of the
proposed framework for probabilistic analysis of electronic systems: an
efficient approach to multidimensional interpolation. The interpolation
technique is based on the Smolyak algorithm, which enables the interpolation to
be performed in an adaptive hierarchical manner, highly beneficial for practical
computations. The overall technique has been consolidated in \aref{construct}
and \aref{evaluate}.
