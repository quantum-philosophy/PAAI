In this section, we present the interpolation algorithm that forms the core of
the proposed framework for probabilistic analysis of electronic systems. The
algorithm is based on the work in \cite{jakeman2012, klimke2006, ma2009}, and it
features a sparse-grid structure, hierarchical construction, and hybrid
adaptivity. The benefits of these features are interconnected and can be
summarized as follows: the ability to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and,
thereby, tackle multidimensional problems; the ability to perform gradual
refinement of the approximation with a natural error control; and the ability to
make the refinement fine-grained and, hence, gain further efficiency.

Let $\f$ be a function that we would like to approximate. The function is
assumed to be in $\continuous([0, 1]^\nin)$, the space of continuous functions
in the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^\nin$. The assumption is a formality, and the
interpolation algorithm discussed in \sref{implementation} can be applied to
functions with finite discontinuities as well, which is actually the case in the
example given in \fref{motivation}. Furthermore, the domain $[0, 1]^\nin$ is
merely standardization rather than a restriction.

In what follows, we shall gradually construct an efficient interpolant for $\f$.
Efficiency here refers to the number of collocation nodes required to achieve a
certain accuracy level.

To summarize, we have obtained an efficient algorithm for adaptive hierarchical
interpolation in multiple dimensions. The main equations are \eref{surplus} and
\eref{smolyak-hierarchical} where $\vx_{\vi\vj}$ and $\e_{\vi\vj}$ are the ones
given in \sref{collocation-nodes} and \sref{basis-functions}, respectively, and
$\Delta\oindex_\vi$ is generally replaced by its subset according to the hybrid
adaptation strategy presented in \sref{adaptivity}. In the next subsection, we
would like to give an algorithmic structure of the technique in order to
streamline its implementation.
