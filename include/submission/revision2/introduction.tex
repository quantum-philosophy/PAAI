Dear Reviewers,

\vspace{2em}
\noindent Thank you for your time and feedback. Please find below our response
to your comments. In our answers, we shall use ``[Surname, Year]'' to refer to
an entry in the list of references. The text of the comments is placed in
\reviewerBox{boxes} with dark gray borders and pale blue backgrounds. The
comments are labeled as ``\cref{M}{N}'' where $M$ is the number of the reviewer,
and $N$ is the number of the comment. Each box with a comment is followed by our
response and a short summary of the taken actions given as a checklist
\done{highlighted} with a blue color and underlined. In the manuscript, the new
and updated parts are \updated{marked} with a red color and underlined. The
changed figures are placed in \figureBox{boxes} with red borders and pale red
backgrounds.

\noindent Sincerely yours,\\
Ivan Ukhov, Petru Eles, and Zebo Peng
