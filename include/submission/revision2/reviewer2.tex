The revised version is much improved compared to the first submission. Most of
my comments have been addressed in the new version.

In terms of organization, I think there are too many sections and I recommend
merging some of them and use subsections when appropriate.

In terms of experimental evaluation, I find the ``Real-life Example'' section a
bit unsatisfying. If running the simulator is expensive, wouldn't it help to
compare with the measurements of an actual processor running the target image
processing application? The simulator can be used in the same way with
appropriate configuration to the processor.

Here are some minor mistakes that should be fixed:

\noindent- ``perse'' should be ``per se''

\noindent- ``These many samples'' instead of ``This many samples''.
