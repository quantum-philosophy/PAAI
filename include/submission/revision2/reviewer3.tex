However, I am a bit confused on the addition of Section XI.C. This section is
valuable, but it is written in an extremely compact way. I was expecting a set
of graphs similar to Figure 5. It would be great if less is shown from the
synthetic example, and more from actual simulations.

We agree that the subsection in question---which is now Sec.~VII-C due to the
changes associated with \cref{2}{1}---feels rather dense. In order to make it
more welcoming, we have revisited the language that is used in that subsection,
reconsidered the subsection's organization with respect to paragraphs, and added
a number of clarifying details.

Let us now turn to the graphs mentioned by the reviewer. Each of those graphs
shows how our accuracy changes as the number of interpolation points increases.
This accuracy is measured with respect to the reference solution that is
obtained by exhaustive sampling. As we discussed in our response to the first
revision and write in Sec.~VII-C, obtaining such a solution is prohibitively
expensive in the case of the real-life example due to the large simulation
times. Consequently, we were not able to provide a graph similar to those in
Fig.~5 for the real-life example.

We would like to emphasize that the main purpose of the real-life example is to
ensure that it is indeed straightforward to deploy the proposed framework, which
is what we claim in the paper. Moreover, since the corresponding infrastructure
has been open-sourced, potential practitioners can go over and study the exact
steps that need to be taken in order to apply the framework; they can also reuse
the whole infrastructure or make use of a subset of its components.

Here is another suggestion to increase the results, feel free to use it. Use
VIPS on actual machines, and rely on the Intel PCM to measure the processor
stats/energy. This should enhance your analysis as you will rely on real-time
measurements rather than simulations.
