However, I am a bit confused on the addition of Section XI.C. This section is
valuable, but it is written in an extremely compact way. I was expecting a set
of graphs similar to Figure 5. It would be great if less is shown from the
synthetic example, and more from actual simulations.

Here is another suggestion to increase the results, feel free to use it. Use
VIPS on actual machines, and rely on the Intel PCM to measure the processor
stats/energy. This should enhance your analysis as you will rely on real-time
measurements rather than simulations.
