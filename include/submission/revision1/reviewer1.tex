The article proposes a system-level framework for early estimation and analysis
of an electronic system given a task graph and a heterogeneous platform. The
framework proposes a general approach which is based on hybrid adaptivity on a
sparse grid  for early estimation for the different quality of interest (e.e
power, delay).

Here are my comments to the author:

\clabel{1}{1}
The most problem of this article is the style of presentation. it seems that the
article tries to make the problem and approach more complicated than what it is.
The style of writing in particular approach and implementation is very confusing
and completed. It makes the paper very difficult to follow. I do like the
motivation example in the introduction, however, the rest of paper significantly
lack the real examples and illustrative figures. My suggestion is to build a
story with a real example of a task graph and a platform when describing the
approach and implementation.

The second major problem of the article is the experimental results. It claimed
in the article, the approach can be applied to different platforms with
different heterogeneous processors, the experimental results stay as a random
statistical model of platform and task graphs with no insight correlated to the
challenges of a real platform. I expect authors can apply their approach their
to measure a metric when an abstract but real application mapped to an abstract
model of a real platform.

Wording suggestion, please replace the ``quality of interest'' with ``metric''.
It is more understandable and less confusing.

The reason we chose the term \emph{quantity of interest} is that it is the one
used in the literature on uncertainty quantification. However, we agree with the
reviewer that, in this particular context, it might not well known and, hence,
might lead to unnecessary confusion; \emph{metric} is a better choice.

It is mentioned in the article that the implementation is  based on [4],
[5],[6]. I like to see the difference between the proposed implementation and
the ones presented in [4][5][6]. There is no comparison in the related work.
They all are based on hybrid adaptivity on a sparse grid.

Authors see the heterogeneous platform as a heterogeneous processor elements
with behavior modeled as Gaussian distribution. Real platforms are the
combination of processors as well as communication fabric and shared memory with
run-time and data-dependent arbitration. It is not clear how the approach can
capture the effect of communication and shared memory when estimating a certain
metric.
