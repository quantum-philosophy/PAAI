\begin{reviewer}
The paper presents an adaptive interpolation approach for estimating the
distribution of a quantity of interest g that depends on uncertain parameters u.
The paper is motivated by the fact that electronic systems often  exhibit
uncertain run-time behaviors due to variation in both the physical and cyber
world. The proposed approach treats the system as a black box, and estimates the
probability distribution g(u) by first reducing g(u) to a surrogate g(z) where z
is extracted from u and then evaluating g(z) using using interpolation on a set
of adaptively chosen sample points.

Overall, the paper is well organized. The English is colloquial at times and
should be improved in the revised version.

The reviewer has not specified the expressions whose usage is not appropriate;
however, based on our own judgment, we have tried to identify and eliminate or
replace the expressions that might be considered colloquial. For example, the
following words and phrases have been revisited:

I am not an expert in probability distribution estimation so I cannot comment on
the novelty of the estimation approach. However, the motivation and results of
the proposed approach are convincing. Compared to existing methods, the approach
proposed addresses problems such as nondifferentiability and discontinuity in
the dependence on the uncertain parameters, and also requires lesser number of
samples to reach a certain degree of accuracy for estimating the probability
distribution of the quantity of interest.

There are several clarification I would like the authors to make in the
revision.

\clabel{3}{2}
First, I think the claim of treating the system as a blackbox is somewhat
misleading. In particular, the approach needs to use the dependency among the
uncertain parameters to construct the surrogate g(z). This is also evident in
the example after Remark~1 where the correlation matrix is assumed to be given.
This can be unrealistic and I would like to understand how this restriction
impacts the proposed approach.

\begin{authors}
The reviewer is absolutely right that the distribution of the uncertain
parameters is needed for the construction of a surrogate.

Another problem I have is with Figure~5. Why is the initial error (at 0 sample)
lower for blue than red? In fact, why is it non-zero for the proposed approach?

We agree.
