The life cycle of interpolation has roughly two stages: construction and usage.
The construction stage invokes $\f$ at a set of collocation nodes and produces
certain artifacts. The usage stage estimates the values of $\f$ at a set of
arbitrary points by manipulating the artifacts. In this subsection, we shall
look at the pseudocodes of the two stages. The purpose is to give the big
picture. A lot of implementation details are purposely omitted; however, all the
details can be found and studied online as our implementation is open source
\cite{sources}.

Let us first make a general note. We found it beneficial to the clarity and ease
of implementation to collapse the two sums in \eref{approximation} into one.
This requires storing a level index $\vi = (i_k)_{k = 1}^\nin$ and an order
index $\vj = (j_k)_{k = 1}^\nin$ for each interpolation element. It is also
advantageous to encode each pair $(i_k, j_k)$ as a single unsigned integer,
which, in particular, eliminates excessive memory usage. In multiple dimensions,
this results in a single vector $\vl = (\iota_k)_{k = 1}^\nin$, which we simply
call an index. The encoding that we utilize is as follows:
\[
  \iota_k = i_k \lor (j_k \ll \n_\text{bits})
\]
where $\lor$ and $\ll$ are the bitwise \up{OR} and logical left shift,
respectively, and $\n_\text{bits}$ is the number of bits reserved for storing
Smolyak levels, which can be adjusted according to the maximum permitted
deepness of interpolation.

The pseudocode of the construction stage is given in \aref{construct} called
\token{Construct}. The \token{target} input is a function $\f$ to be
approximated. The \token{surrogate} output is a structure containing the
artifacts of interpolation, which are a set of tuples $\{ (\vl_k,
\surplus(\vx_{\vl_k}) \}_k$, giving a comprehensive description of an
interpolant. The routine works as follows.

\begin{compactlist}

\point{Line~2:} Each iteration is an interpolation step in \eref{approximation}.
It has a state captured by a structure denoted by \token{s}. The
\token{strategy} object represents an adaptation strategy utilized and works as
described in \sref{adaptivity}. The \token{First} method of \token{strategy}
returns the initial state of the first step so that the \token{indices} field of
\token{s} is initialized with the indices of that step. The body of the loop
populates the rest of the fields of \token{s} so that \token{strategy.Next} can
adequately produce the initial state of the next iteration. The process
terminates when a stopping condition is satisfied, in which case \token{Next}
returns a null state.

\point{Line~3:} The \token{grid} object represents the interpolation grid
utilized (see \sref{grid}), and its \token{Compute} method converts the step's
indices into the coordinates of the corresponding collocation nodes, that is,
$\{ \vl_k \}_k$ into $\{ \vx_{\vl_k} \}_k$.

\point{Line~4:} \token{Invoke} evaluates \token{target} at the collocation
nodes. This is a prominent candidate for parallelization since the algorithm
does not impose any evaluation order; $\f$ can be calculated simultaneously for
all the nodes of the iteration.

\point{Line~5:} \token{Evaluate} exercises the interpolant constructed so far at
the collocation nodes, approximating the values obtained on line~4. This
function will be discussed separately.

\point{Line~6:} \token{Subtract} computes the difference between the true and
approximated values of \token{target}, which yields the step's hierarchical
surpluses $\{ \surplus(\vx_{\vl_k}) \}_k$, similar to \eref{surplus}.

\point{Line~7:} \token{strategy.Score} calculates the scores of the new
collocation nodes based on their surpluses; see \eref{score}.

\point{Line~8:} \token{Append} improves the interpolant by extending it with the
indices and surpluses of the current iteration.

\end{compactlist}

We now turn to the usage stage of an interpolant. The pseudocode is given in
\aref{evaluate} called \token{Evaluate}. This algorithm is also involved in
\aref{construct}; see line~5. Let us make a couple of observations regarding
\token{Evaluate}.

\begin{compactlist}

\point{Line~4:} The inner loop is an unfolded version of \eref{approximation}
(there is no separation between individual interpolation steps taken).

\point{Line~5:} The \token{basis} object represents the interpolation basis
utilized (see \sref{basis}), and its \token{Compute} method evaluates a single
(multidimensional) basis function at a single point.

\end{compactlist}

It is worth noting that the \token{basis}, \token{grid}, and \token{strategy}
objects conform to certain interfaces and can be easily swapped out. This makes
the two algorithms very general and reusable with different configurations. In
particular, the adaptation strategy can be fine-tuned for each particular
problem.
