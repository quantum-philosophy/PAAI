We have presented a framework for probabilistic analysis of multiprocessors
systems. Our approach is based on adaptive hierarchical interpolation on sparse
grids.

Lastly, we would like to remind that, despite the fact this work is mainly
oriented towards digital sources of uncertainty, the proposed framework is
expected to perform well when modeling other uncertainties such as those due to
process variation.
