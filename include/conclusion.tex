In this paper, we have presented a framework for probabilistic analysis of
electronic systems. The framework makes mild, practical assumptions about the
information available to the designer regarding the uncertainty present in the
system at hand. Thereafter, it prescribes the steps that need to be taken in
order to computationally efficiently obtain the probability distribution of the
quantity that is of interest to the designer.

The proposed approach is powered by hierarchical interpolation following a
hybrid adaptation strategy. The adaptivity makes the framework particularly
suited for problems with idiosyncratic behaviors and steep response surfaces,
which arise in electronic systems due to their digital nature.

The performance of our framework has been assessed by comparing it with the
performance of an advance sampling technique. The experimental results have
shown that, for a fixed budget of evaluations of the quantity of interest, our
approach achieves higher accuracy compared to direct simulations.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that, even though the framework has been
exemplified by considering a specific source of uncertainty and specific
quantities of interest, it is general and can be successfully applied in many
other settings. In particular, the framework is expected to perform well when it
is used for analyzing the uncertainties originating from the physical world such
as those due to process variation.
