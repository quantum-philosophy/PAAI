In this paper, we have presented a framework for probabilistic analysis of
electronic systems. Given a description of the probability distribution of the
uncertain parameters present in the system under consideration and a simulator
of a quantity of interest dependent on the parameters, the framework prescribes
the steps that need to be taken in order to computationally efficiently obtain
the probability distribution of the quantity.

The proposed approach is powered by hierarchical interpolation following a
hybrid adaptation strategy. The adaptivity makes the framework particularly
suited for problems with idiosyncratic behaviors and steep response surfaces,
which arise in electronic systems due to their digital nature.

The performance of our framework has been assessed by comparing it with the
performance of an advanced sampling technique. The experimental results have
shown that, for a fixed budget of evaluations of the quantity of interest, our
approach achieves higher accuracy compared to direct simulations.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that, even though the framework has been
exemplified by considering a specific source of uncertainty and specific
quantities of interest, it is general and can be successfully applied in many
other settings. In particular, the framework is expected to perform well when it
is used for analyzing the uncertainties originating from the physical world such
as those due to process variation.
