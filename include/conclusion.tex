We have presented a framework for probabilistic analysis of electronic systems.
The framework makes mild, practical assumptions about the information available
to the designer regarding the uncertainty present in the system at hand.
Thereafter, it prescribes the steps that need to be taken in order to
computationally efficiently obtain the probability distribution of the quantity
that is of interest to the designer.

The proposed approach is based on hierarchical interpolation on sparse grids
guided by a hybrid adaptation strategy. The adaptivity makes the framework
particularly suited for problems with idiosyncratic behaviors and steep response
surfaces, which arise in electronic systems due to their digital nature.

The performance of our framework has been assessed by comparing it with the one
of an advance sampling technique. The experimental results have shown that, for
a fixed budget of evaluations of the quantity of interest, our approach achieves
higher accuracy compared to direct simulations.

Lastly, we would like to remind that, even though the framework has been
exemplified by considering a specific source of uncertainty and specific
quantities of interest, it is general and can be successfully applied in many
other settings.
