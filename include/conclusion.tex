In this paper, we have presented a framework for probabilistic analysis of
electronic systems. \updated{Given a description of the probability distribution
of the uncertain parameters present in the system under consideration and a
simulator of a metric of interest dependent on the parameters, the framework
prescribes the steps that need to be taken in order to computationally
efficiently obtain the probability distribution of the metric.}

The proposed approach is powered by hierarchical interpolation following a
hybrid adaptation strategy. The adaptivity makes the framework particularly
suited for problems with idiosyncratic behaviors and steep response surfaces,
which arise in electronic systems due to their digital nature.

The performance of our framework has been assessed by comparing it with the
performance of an advanced sampling technique. \updated{The experimental results
have shown that, for a fixed budget of evaluations of the metric, our approach
achieves higher accuracy compared to direct simulations.}

\updated{Finally, we would like to emphasize that, even though the framework has
been exemplified by considering a specific source of uncertainty and specific
metrics, it is general and can be successfully applied in many other settings.}
