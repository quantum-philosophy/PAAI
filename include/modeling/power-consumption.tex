Denote the mapping of the application $\tasks$ onto the platform $\procs$ by a
vector $\mapping = (m_i)_{i = 1}^{\nt}$ wherein $m_i \in \procs$ is the index of
the processing element that the $i$th task is assigned to. Let the dynamic power
consumption of the tasks be fixed during their execution and given by a vector
$\vp^\dynamic = (\p^\dynamic_i)_{i = 1}^{\nt}$ wherein $\p^\dynamic_i$ is the
dynamic power of the $i$th task.

\begin{remark}
The boundaries of a task have not been specified, and one can perform modeling
at the level of granularity that makes the most sense for a particular problem.
\end{remark}

Let a time-dependent vector $\vp(\t) = (\p_i(\t))_{i = 1}^{\np}$ capture the
total power consumption of the system at time $\t$. This vector should not be
confused with the vector $\vp^\dynamic$ introduced in the previous paragraph.
The two are related as follows:
\begin{equation} \elab{power}
  \p_i(\t) = \sum_{j = 1}^\nt \p^\dynamic_j \: \delta_{i\,m_j} \: \one_{[\b_j, \b_j + \d_j)}(\t) + \p^\static_i(\t, \q_i(\t)),
\end{equation}
for $i = 1, \dots, \np$, where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, $\one_A(x)$
is the indicator function of a set $A$, and $\p^\static_i$ is the static power
consumption of the $i$th processing element, which depends \cite{liu2007} on the
instant temperature of that processing element denoted by $\q_i$ (see the next
subsection). In words, the above equation yields the dynamic power of the task
running on the $i$th processing element at time $\t$, if any, plus the static
power.

Given a set of time moments of interest, \eref{power} can be used to construct
the corresponding power profile $\mP \in \real^{\np \times \ns}$ of the system,
which is essentially a matrix whose $i$th row captures the evolution of the
power consumption of the $i$th processing element over $\ns$ time moments.

Another highly valuable quantity, which can be calculated at this point, is the
total energy consumption. To this end, \eref{power} has to be integrated over
the time span of the application:
\begin{align}
  \text{Total energy} &= \sum_{i = 1}^\np \int \p_i(\t) \, d\t \elab{total-energy} \\
                      &= \vd^T \vp^\dynamic + \sum_{i = 1}^\np \int \p^\static_i(\t, \q_i(\t)) \, d\t. \nonumber
\end{align}

A power profile $\mP$ as well as the above quantity are candidates for $\g$. In
the former case, $\g$ has $\np \ns$ outputs.
